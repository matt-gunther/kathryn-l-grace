I use survey data, field work (focus groups, observation and interviews), remotely sensed data and other types of geophysical data to investigate the ways that people interact with their environment.  
In particular, I focus on food insecurity, children’s health and women’s health in a context of climate change.  I also focus on how women manage their nutritional needs while pregnant and breastfeeding. As part of this research, I investigate the decisions that women and men make regarding childbearing and contraceptive use while coping with food insecurity.  My research is primarily focused in some of the poorest countries in the world in West Africa, East Africa and Central America.
